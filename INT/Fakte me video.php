    <ul>
      <li>A ring is an unbroken circle, which many cultures understand as representative of eternit</li>
      <li>The custom of giving and receiving finger rings dates back over 6000 years.</li>
      <li>The earliest rings were made of simple iron, but gold rings set with gems were fashionable by medieval days.</li>
      <li>The tradition of wearing the engagement ring and wedding band on the fourth finger of the left hand can be traced to the Egyptians, who believed the vena amoris (vein of love) ran directly from the heart to the top of this finger.</li>
      <li>Roman men would “claim” their woman with the giving of a ring as a symbol of ownership.</li>
      <li>Wedding rings through different stages in history have been worn on different fingers, including the thumb, and on both the left and right hands</li>
      <li>The custom of men wearing wedding rings was not common until World War II when men fighting overseas wore rings as reminders of their wives and families at home.</li>

          &#9644;  Don’t wear it when you go to practice sport.<br>
          
          &#9641; Store it in a dry and soft place.<br>
         
          
        &#9725; Choose rhodium plated silver jewelry. It won’t become black!<br>
